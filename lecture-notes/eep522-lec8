complexity harms safety-critical
Byzantine generals problem
Voting systems
Data integrity
- Stack checking
- Making stack safe, corruption is common problem
	+ High tide watermark, stack limit, safety buffer (both sides)
	+ Use scheduler to check stack pointer is within bounds
Interrupts
	+ Should they be used in safety critical?
		+ No, use polling, interrupts impose test burden, unpredictable
	+ Should safety critcial use dynamic memory?
JPL rules
1. don't use task delays for thread synchronization
2. restrictions on the use of semaphores and locks
3. do not use goto, setjmp or longjmp
Defensive code writing
Code clarity
Issues with runtime error correction
Error correcting codes
+ ECC error correcting memory
Watchdog timer
+ can send intterupt or reset system when not responding
Autonomous driving
+ sensor-actuator logic
+ complex journey
+ overalll safety is responsivility of technology integrator -> someone to blame legally
+ dangerous time when mixture of autonomous technologies and human control exist
+ as systems become more complex there is a need to determine "Human Intent"
	+ understanding what a human is likely to do 
	+ will the human cross the road?, have they fallen asleep?
	+ important if human is emergency control system
+ non-invasive BCI may be solution to some problems
+ majority of austraillia accidents was low blood sugar
Human intent graph w/ automation
Case study: safety standard DO-178
+ Embedded / RTOS have been certified with safety level, uCOS, VXWorks
+ DO-178 defines guidelines for aviation software
	+ certification levels, A-E
Final thoughts

Simulation/Emulaiton
"A simulation is the answer to the quiestion, 'what-if'" - Richard W. Hamming
+ testing on real hardware is expensive
+ SnE gives embed eng. chance to see in future
+ takes time, can provide misleading info, difficult to get accurate measurements, no causal effects
+ simulation merging with vr/ar + growing popularity with webassembly
FirePOWER
+ Steve Jobs
+ Tasked with breaking things
+ exploding whale video
+ hardware couldn't reach the end of video
	+ hardware engineers went to simulator
Resources
+ spice, qemu, computer related risks - Peter G Neumann
+ RTL, game emulation, flight simulator, wind tunnel, wave simulator, weather simulator, earth simulator
Introduction

Accuracy
+ How close a quantity is to its actual value
+ how close simulator is to hardware
+ accuracy comes at cost of speed, cost

Why could simulation be useful for machine learning?
+ Digital twin - train the model in the simulator

Emulation
+ replacement for a system
+ e.g. emulation of SoC
+ behaviorally correct

simulaiton
+ models as actual device
+ analyze and make predictions
+ processor behavio at each stage of the pipeline
+ simulation attempts to reproduce a processors behavior
+ compiile/build enviroment, prototype, optimization, scheduling sequence, cache corner cases
+ advantages
	+ find problems before they occur
	+ start porting software prior to availability
	+ act as known base device
	+ useful when prototype hardware is limited
	+ safe environment to develop software
	+ useful with hardware limited
+ technologies
	+ SoCs/processorc executing RTL
	+ dedicated hardware
	+ CADENCE Palladium
+ software
	+ eumulates programming env
	+ runs on gnu/linux, windows
	+ low cost
	+ might be faster than hardware
	+ not timing accurate
	+ gdb has builtin simulator
+ soft emulators
QEMU
- open source software emulator
- mips, powerpc, sh4, arm, ....
- executes oses and programs
- binary translation or native execution
Microsoft Device Emulator

Architecture vs Microarchitecture

Gem5
- simulator
- modular platform
- system-level architecture
- processor architecture

How useful would emulator have been for your assignments?

SPICE
- simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis
- board level design
- passing fcc emission

Gazebo
- used for ROS

CARLA
- autonomous cars

Most basic emulation
- API emulation

Models
- representation of reality used to simulate
project lifecycle
- validataion

Modeling event difficulty
- problem not predicting the future
- astronauts in simulation test attempted to abort, astronauts tried aborting the abort
- simulation went into a continuous loop
- nobody anticipated someone would abort twice
Simulation failure
- solution only as good as simulator
- lossing america's cup racing boat victimized by computer modelling
- iterations on improved designs gave worse results
Co-design / co-engineering
- co-design hardware and software designed together
- goal is to produce the most optimal design
- heavy use of simulation tech
- difficult to achieve
Virtual machines
- machine completely defined and implemented in software
- runtime environment
- compiled code called intermediate language
- mimics real processor
- issues
	+ determinism, have gbc

Darpa event
- for funding
- emerging threats
	- energy, power plants, grid infrastructure
- should be well employed
	- aging population, africa has younger population

renesas develops ai accelerator for lightweight ai models
Rust embedded-hal crate
Milk-V DUO S - $11

Space ROS, Astrobee

Curiosity Rover
- Sleeping
	+ normal sleep watchdog timer wakes it up
	+ failsafe, comms remain powered alow orbiter to wake-up rover
- memory corruption
	+ tlelmetry data showed problem in flash memory
	+ caused sotware tasks to hang
	wouldnt' sleep
	+ watchdog timers didn't trigger
	+ from earth, and comms lost, couldn't come back
	+ switched over to side-B computer
	+ identified single bad flash chip on side-A

MMRTG characteristics
- loses 1 watt per 80 days
